This is a compiler written for my compiler class in the university. It's highly unlikely I'll continue working on this project.

I began writing it about 6 months prior to taking the classes, learning by myself. The actual design is pretty bad, but I believe it to be a lot better than what the professor thought in the classes. This version is a last-minute version; I should have sent the whole Git history with nice features such an intermediate code (similar to TAC found in the Dragon Book), with C code generation as well, but decided against it so I could be sure that the code generation would work for the pevalutation.

Both the compiler and the virtual machine have user interfaces in Brazilian Portuguese. No translation is available.
